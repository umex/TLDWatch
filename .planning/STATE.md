# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-11)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap uses 10 phases, mvp mode, standard granularity — derived from research/SUMMARY.md build-order rationale.
- Project skill guidance loaded; project skills directory was absent in this run, so no per-skill rules were applied.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Research-flagged unknowns that affect upcoming phases:

- Phase 2: ROCm on Windows for the 6800 XT in mid-2026 — cannot be verified at research time; first-run GPU-burn test must be the ground truth.
- Phase 3: faster-whisper + int8 version pins, VRAM profile on 8 GB laptop.
- Phase 6: yt-dlp state for age-gated / region-locked videos in mid-2026.
- Phase 7: pyannote "expected N speakers" mode exact knob and reliability.
- Phase 8: Qwen2.5 vs Llama-3 vs Mistral benchmark on laptop + GBNF grammar expressibility for the four templates.
