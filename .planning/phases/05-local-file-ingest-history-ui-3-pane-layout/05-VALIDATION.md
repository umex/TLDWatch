# Phase 5 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.
> Derived from `## Validation Architecture` in `05-RESEARCH.md`.

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework (back-end)** | pytest 8 + pytest-asyncio (existing, `asyncio_mode="auto"`) |
| **Config file (back-end)** | `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` (testpaths=["tests"]) |
| **Quick run command (back-end)** | `pytest tests/test_<module>.py -x` |
| **Full suite command (back-end)** | `pytest` |
| **Framework (front-end)** | Vitest 8 (ships with Vite) — NEW, to be configured in `web/` |
| **Config file (front-end)** | `web/vitest.config.ts` (Wave 0 — does not exist yet) |
| **Quick run command (front-end)** | `cd web && npx vitest run <file>` |
| **Full suite command (front-end)** | `cd web && npx vitest run` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~30 seconds (back-end full suite) + ~10 seconds (FE suite) |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit (back-end):** Run `pytest tests/test_upload_stream.py tests/test_transcript_endpoint.py -x`
- **After every task commit (front-end):** Run `cd web && npx vitest run`
- **After every plan wave (merge):** Run `pytest` (full back-end — must stay green; 42 existing test files) + `cd web && npx vitest run`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full back-end + front-end suites must be green; the memory-bound guarantee test (tracemalloc peak assertion) MUST pass.
- **Max feedback latency:** ~30 seconds

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky · W0 = Wave 0 stub needed*

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] `tests/test_upload_stream.py` — stubs for INGEST-01 (streaming write, atomic rename, race prevention)
- [ ] `tests/test_upload_memory.py` — stubs for INGEST-01 memory-bound guarantee (`tracemalloc` peak < N MB during a >100MB fixture upload)
- [ ] `tests/test_upload_atomic.py` — stubs for INGEST-01 atomic cleanup
- [ ] `tests/test_upload_race.py` — stubs for INGEST-01 race prevention
- [ ] `tests/test_transcript_endpoint.py` — stubs for D-14 (`GET /jobs/{id}/transcript`, 404 when none)
- [ ] `tests/test_upload_idempotency.py` — stubs for D-11 idempotent re-drop
- [ ] `tests/test_history_list.py` — stubs for JOB-03 (history list)
- [ ] `web/vitest.config.ts` — Vitest config for the new FE codebase (jsdom environment for scroll-spy + component tests) — created TDD-style in 05-02a Task 1 (not pre-stubbed in a separate Wave 0 task)
- [ ] `web/src/test/setup.ts` — Vitest setup (mock IntersectionObserver, mock WebSocket, mock fetch, mock XHR) — created TDD-style in 05-02a Task 1 (not pre-stubbed)
- [ ] `web/src/hooks/useScrollSpy.test.ts` — covers UI-03 — created TDD-style in 05-03 Task 1 (RED-GREEN within the implementation task; not pre-stubbed in a separate Wave 0 task)
- [ ] `web/src/api/jobs.test.ts` — covers JOB-03 (history list fetch + transcript fetch) + the useUpload progress 0->100 assertion (D-02) — created TDD-style in 05-02b Task 2 (not pre-stubbed)
- [ ] `web/src/pages/DetailPage.test.tsx` — covers UI-01 (2-pane detail grid) + UI-02 (no `<video>`) — created TDD-style in 05-02b Task 1 (not pre-stubbed)
- [ ] FE framework install: `cd web && npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react jsdom` — performed in 05-02a Task 1 (part of the Vite scaffold, not a separate Wave 0 step)

> **FE test stub strategy (INFO 4 resolution):** the FE test files (`DetailPage.test.tsx`, `jobs.test.ts`, `useScrollSpy.test.ts`) and the Vitest infra (`vitest.config.ts`, `setup.ts`) are NOT pre-stubbed in a dedicated Wave 0 task. They are created TDD-style (RED-GREEN) within their implementation tasks (05-02a Task 1, 05-02b Tasks 1+2, 05-03 Task 1) because the FE is greenfield and each test is co-located with the code it specifies. The back-end Wave 0 stubs (the 7 `tests/test_*.py` files) ARE pre-stubbed in 05-01 Task 1 per the existing pattern. The `nyquist_compliant` / sign-off below is the verifier's job at execution time; this revision only clarifies the FE stub strategy.

*Existing back-end test infrastructure (pytest, conftest.py, httpx `ASGITransport`) covers the integration test path — new routes are tested via the same `httpx.AsyncClient` + FastAPI app pattern used by the 42 existing test files.*

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| 3-pane/2-pane layout visually matches UI-SPEC §4 across breakpoints | UI-01 | Visual layout fidelity needs human eyes at multiple viewport widths | Drag a window across mobile/tablet/desktop widths; confirm history + transcript + summary panes match UI-SPEC §4 grid |
| Drag-and-drop feel (no page reload, drop-zone highlight) | INGEST-01 | Browser DnD gesture + visual affordance not asserted by jsdom | Drag a file over the drop zone; confirm highlight + that drop triggers upload without reload |
| Active-line highlight tracks scroll position smoothly | UI-03 | Real scroll + IntersectionObserver timing varies in jsdom | Scroll the transcript pane; confirm the visible line stays highlighted and updates without flicker |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 30s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
